## Project Name - **A Sorting Visualizer** 💪🏽👀🧑🏼‍💻
<br>

> I am driven by **What if?**

<br>

## Motivation 💪🏽☀️
I believe in learning a tool by making things using that tool itself. I am also learning DSA side by side so I got a perfect idea. Why not create a sorting visualizer? I had already seen some of them on youtube and they never cease to amaze. I am driven by the mentality of **What If?**. 
I was already in the process of learning ReactJS from quite a few months and realized that I need to get into some unknown territory so that I can encounter new challenges and overcome those. What were those challenges? Initially I had some idea that there is going to be a lot of re-rendering of components (bars) during this project. Along with that I also knew that I need to create a good and efficient state structure, that could manage multiple algorithms. It almost took me two week to create a first deployable version of the app. But I have few other things in mind that I will be bringing in future versions.

## Expectation 😁👦🏽
Initial expectations were following - 
- Understand how React Asynchronous Rendering proces works
- Understanding how to add user-induced delay between renders of certain components
- Understand how to create a future-proof codes, which are easily extensive, a use case was to gradually adding more algorithms and their visualization logic without modifying existing code ***(much)***
- How to use React.useContext, React.memo, React.useCallback, React.useMemo
- Learn a utility-class-based UI library and make soothing UI and transitions

## Scope ⏳🥅
Two weeks back, I just had an aim to create something that could atleast show me actual sorting visualization of the vertical bars. So on day -1, scope was very simple. The scope infact developed on each step of development, where at the end of first week, I made up in my mind that following would be the scope of version 1.0.0 of **A Sorting Visualizer** - 
- User can select among three sorting algorithms namely, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort,
- User can select the array size that they want to sort,
- User can select ***(perceived)*** sorting speed of the running sorting visualization,
